    <h2> My Rationale</h2>
    <p>Tiering is based on moddability, usability, the learning curve, look and feel, and bugs.<br>
        KSP 2 got FAILURE tier because Take Two scammed us and fired all the devs. <br> <img src="ripksp2.jpg" height="400" width="900" alt="This is supposed to be a Twitter post by KozaK bashing Take Two for firing everyone in the KSP2 Dev Team.">
        Juno New origins AKA Simple rocket's sequel got D tier because of the high learning curve and complex controls.<br>
        SFS got A tier for moddability [On PC only :c ].<br>
        Space Simulator got B tier because the last time I played it, it didn't have many crafts, but made up for it with amazing autopilot;<br>
        preventing it from going to C tier.<br>
        Futhermore, Simple Rockets 1 had no maneuvering system or anything. Meaning you had to launch and pray to God that you get an encounter with enough fuel to land. <br>
        Enough said. F TIER.<br><br><br>
        Maybe in my final, I can post a tier list of concept games (which would as of November 3rd 2024 consist of 1 entry. Not much of a list, hm?)

<!--
    Tier list page must rank something accordingly and include:
        properly structured headings
        a properly structured HTML table with headers and data cells.
        at least six rows (header row, then tier ranking system like, S, A, B, C, and D or create your own ranking mechanism) 
        at least six columns -  Rank whatever you want! (Candy, TV Characters, CCBC Classes?)
        at least two images in the table
        a paragraph with a heading for your reflection
    The contact form page:
        the form must include:
            Name, email address, text comment field and use form elements that ask three more questions questions related to the tierlist
        must include at least five different form elements.
        please note: the form will not DO anything. It's just an example form for this project. (see bonus points below)
    Both pages must be styled consistently using an external CSS file
    Both pages must link to each other in a simple navigation bar or sidebar.
    Ensure that the table and form (are accessible and easy to use (labels, scope, etc.)
    Validate the HTML and CSS files and correct any errors.
