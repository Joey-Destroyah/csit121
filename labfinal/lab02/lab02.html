    <p>heya. this is my first actual webpage since AP CSA. It's been a loong time since I made one of these,</p>
        <p> and I am happy to be back, even if for a short while. Maybe I can make a webpage for my 3D Prints with CSS when this is all over.</p>
        <main>
            <a href="/lab01/lab01.html">Go back to Part 1.</a>

        <footer> In Lab 2, I learned about basic lists and headings. Also learned about linking to external websites.<br>
        As you can tell, I've learned CSS as well. Here is my link to <a href="/lab03/lab03.html">Lab 3.</a></footer>
