    <h2> My Rationale</h2>
    <p>Tiering is based on moddability, usability, the learning curve, look and feel, and bugs.<br>
        KSP 2 got FAILURE tier because Take Two scammed us and fired all the devs. <br> 
        <img class="image" src="ripksp2.jpg" height="400" width="900" alt="This is supposed to be a Twitter post by KozaK bashing Take Two for firing everyone in the KSP2 Dev Team.">
        Juno New origins AKA Simple rocket's sequel got D tier because of the high learning curve and complex controls.<br>
        SFS got A tier for moddability [On PC only :c ].<br>
        Space Simulator got B tier because the last time I played it, it didn't have many crafts, but made up for it with amazing autopilot;<br>
        preventing it from going to C tier.<br>
        Futhermore, Simple Rockets 1 had no maneuvering system or anything. Meaning you had to launch and pray to God that you get an encounter with enough fuel to land. <br>
        Enough said. F TIER.<br><br><br>
        
        Well, the final's arrived, and I'm keeping my promise.
        Here it is.
