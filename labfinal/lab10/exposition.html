            <h3>"What is WebAssembly?"</h3>
    
            <article><h4>WebAssembly is a programming language made for websites.<br>
            The only language supported back in the old days of 2016 for HTML interactivity was JS <br> (JavaScript).<br> <br>
            In March of 2017, WebAssembly was released to the public as a gateway between JavaScript, HTML, and other languages such as C++, <br> Mainline Java,
            Python, or other languages. According to source one, "WASM was never created as a replacement for Javascript, and it can't because the language is so low-level.<br>
            Instead, it's specifically made to complement Javascript and addresses its performance issue when conducting computation and memory-intensive tasks"(ymc9, What are people building with webassembly? 2023) <br>
            There is an API used for JavaScript integration known as WebAssembly JavaScript Interface, used specifically to run JS code faster and more efficient than what barebones HTML integration could likely provide. This uses the WASM code to slash the load time in half if not more.<br><br>

           </article>
<h6> The only thing here that needs explaining is that I used an internal CSS to style this, also placing the WASM logo as the background image.<br>
    Internal CSS is used in all of lab 10, such as with the changing backgrounds and fonts.</h6>
