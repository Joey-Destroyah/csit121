    <h1>"What is WebAssembly even used for?"</h1> <br><br>
    <p>WebAssembly is mostly used for legacy apps that can't just be thrown away into the dumpster that is abandonware.<br>
    WebAssembly is machine-oriented, and enclosed here is an image consisting of sample code. This code was found in source 3.<br>
    If you take a look at the top sample, you'll find that it looks suspiciously like machine code or Assembly.<br><br>
<img src="codescrnsht.jpg" class="image" width="600" alt="this should be a screenshot of machine code seen in WebAssembly. Source: W3C sample.">
<br>Well, I mean, it IS called WebAssembly for a reason; It is named after the low-level language seen in old computers<br>
 (I mean REALLY old, 80s or 90s programs such as games made for the N64).<br>
  Despite the codebase being almost machine code, according to Source 2, this actually has use in triple A games, Video editing, music, image edits, and so much more. <br>
  Bottom line, with WebAssembly, anything is possible with the right knowledge! </p>
