    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>So, what did I learn?<br>
        Well, a lot. Both in CSS, HTML, and about myself. I learned and relearned HTML and CSS. Some JS code as well.
    I also learned the hard way that ANY mistake can mean the difference between a good grade and a terrible one.
       <br> If you want more details about what exactly I learned, I ain't rewriting it here. <br>
        Instead, see the previous pages where the explanations are written out.
        With that, I wish you happy holidays and a merry christmas!
        <br>
        Thank you, and Goodnight.<br>
        Joey
